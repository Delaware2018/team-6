            <p>This page is devoted to showcasing the relationship between Jordan, Carly, and Rachel. Jordan and Carly are recent UD alumni who are excited to be living in New York City. In college, they were extremely active with B+ and wanted to continue their involvement after school. In July, they were matched with Rachel, who soon changed their life forever.</p>

            <p>The girls became immediate friends as soon as they met. It was a match made in heaven and a friendship that will last for a long time. On this page, you can find descriptions of all of their adventures and pictures to accompany them.</p>

            <p>If you see this page and want to support Rachel and children like Rachel, please consider donating at the B+ page. Everyone deserves a childhood and we want to help make that possible.</p>

            <p>We hope you enjoy following our journey -- we centainly have enjoyed making it! If you're interested in becoming a mentor, please visit the apply section and enter your information.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions at all about anything regarding the organization, whether about on campus events or off-campus, post-graduate opportunities, feel free to reach out to Jordan or Carly, as well as the Be Positive staff.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Movie Night!</h2>

            <p>Hi everyone! We're here to tell you about the movie night that we had the other night. We all got together and watched Harry Potter. We ate popcorn and had a great time.</p>

            <p>Who knew Harry Potter was such a good movie? Rachel sure did, but Jordan and Carly didn't. Did you know that Rachel has seen and read every Harry Potter movie/book within the series? Now Jordan and Carly have to catch up.</p>

            <p>We can't wait to all hangout again soon and watch the next one in the series. This is one of the many reasons we love spending time with Rachel -- she shows us new fun things we didn't even know we were missing out on! </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Apple Picking</h2>

            <p>Happy autumn. As fall begins, we decided to show Rachel one of our favorite fall traditions: apple picking. We arrived at 11 am and stayed for hours, picking apples, riding around, and doing other fun fall activities.</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/apple_picking.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted"><p align="left">The three of us on the hayride on the way to apple picking! We had so much fun.</p></span>

            <p>We all loved the hayride! It took us to the apple orchard, but was so nice and scenic. We also got to go in a maze. We didn't get lost at all, thanks to the leadership of our Hero, Rachel.</p>

            <p>We ate so many apples. We tried red delicious, golden delicious, granny smith, honey crisp, and gala apples. They were all so good. We even did an apple scavenger hunt, where we found the prettiest apple, the ugliest apple, a celibrity look-a-like apple, etc. </p>
